# Quiet Code

Quiet Code lets you dim selected lines in your code editor to reduce visual clutter.

Ideal for:

- Tracing data flow
- Simplifying complex files
- Focusing on the logic you care about

---

## Features

- Select any line(s) and toggle dimming with `Cmd+Shift+1`
- Clear all dims in the current file with `Cmd+Shift+2`
- Clear all dims across all files with `Cmd+Shift+0`
- Dim styling is subtle and non-destructive â€” your code stays clean

## Why?

Sometimes, the hardest part of reading code is ignoring what you donâ€™t need.

Quiet Code gives you a soft focus tool â€” think of it like a spotlight for your mind.
